Substance use disorder treatment providers are very specialized in what they do. They may do it well, but it only addresses one aspect of a disease that causes widespread damage to most all areas. 

Factors such as limited time, resources, cost, infrastructure and expertise limits providers from being able to justify offering services outside of their scope. A centralized database of providers is a great accompaniment to any individual seeking to keep the ground that they have already gained.
